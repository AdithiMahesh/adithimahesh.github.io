  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p style="color:black;">Born on 28th March 1995, in a place called Shimoga in Karnataka, India, I was this chubby, foodie girl who bothered my mother every minute for food.  When I was 3 months old, my mother got me back to Bangalore and then began the pampering from my grandparents. Not able to tolerate my mischief I was put to pre-school at the age of two and started my actual schooling at the age of four at Sri Aurobindo Memorial School, Bangalore. Being the obedient, disciplined girl as I always was at school(only at school) made me win my teachers’ hearts and make great friends. I studied in the same school for 11 years and that place groomed me so well, till the extent of me receiving the Best Outgoing Student of the Year Award during my graduation from High school.</p>

<div class=" w3-container w3-padding-64 w3-light-grey" id="passion">
  <h3 class="w3-center">MY PASSIONS</h3>
  <p>Music has been the soul to my heart which gives me every bit of happiness that I feel in life. I started learning Carnatic classical music at the age of 6 from my grandfather, Vid. G. Shankar Rao and simultaneously underwent training from my father, Vid. Mahesh Shankar, from whom I am currently continuing my training, after coming for my Master’s. At the age of 12, I started my training under Vid. Padma Srinivasan. Singing has not just given me name and fame but also the unparalleled happiness and inner peace which everyone wishes for in life. I have received multiple awards and titles like “Voice of Bangalore”, “Melody Maestro”, “Best Singer Award”, “BNM Idol” and “Cultural Ambassador”. Participated and performed in 200+ events which gave me exposure to the competition in the outside world, making me perfect myself every day.

<br>
<br>

My other passion is hiking, which is just like life, a journey which makes me put one foot in front of the other again and again, taking me to great peaks. I have completed more than 20 treks in Western Ghats of Karnataka, experiencing the real beauty of nature. It feels good to be lost in the right direction. Life was meant for good friends and great adventures and hiking gives me just that.

  <h3 class="w3-center">MY TRANSFORMATION STORY</h3>
  <p style="color:black;">Growing up I was always a fat kid.
This never bothered me in any way as I was never fat shamed or teased for my body type, 
so I was as confident as I always was. 
One day, after my high school when my doctor spoke to me and told me about the health implications of being obese, 
I freaked out! A voice from within told me that I must prove that I can do it! 
It seemed impossible to lose weight in the beginning but with my dedication, 
I could finally lose 35 kilos in 11 months. 
The mantra is simple, it just takes a little workout, some healthy diet and a lot of self- motivation and perseverance.</p>
